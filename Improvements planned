1. Add more error handling mechanism and add a roleback script based on exit status, if any AWS CLI command fails (like CloudFormation).
2. Reduce dependencies further:
  a) Create IAM role for EC2 to access S3 using the script itself.
  b) Create Security groups using the script itself (take VPC ID as 3rd argument input)
3. Improve further detail inline documentation (like explaining the argument list of each AWS CLI command)
4. Include all EC2 Instance type for error checking of argument 1 (currently checking for 16 instances).
